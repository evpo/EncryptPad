Test Case: CERT_PATH_COMMON_12

Purpose: Checks the behaviour of the application when a component of the subjectDN is longer than the allowed length. This path is not valid, because the length of one component of the subjectDN is longer than allowed. However, applications may decide to gracefully handle longer names.
