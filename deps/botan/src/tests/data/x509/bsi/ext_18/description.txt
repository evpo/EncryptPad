Test Case: CERT_PATH_EXT_18

Purpose: Checks the behaviour of an application when the intermediate certificate contains a Policy Constraints extension with requireExplicitPolicy=0 and the target certificate does not have the Certificate Policies extension. This path is invalid because an explicit policy is required but the last certificate in the path renders it impossible.
