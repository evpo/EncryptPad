Botan: Crypto and TLS for Modern C++
========================================

Botan (Japanese for peony flower) is a C++ cryptography library released under the
permissive `Simplified BSD <https://botan.randombit.net/license.txt>`_ license.

Botan's goal is to be the best option for cryptography in C++ by offering the
tools necessary to implement a range of practical systems, such as TLS protocol,
X.509 certificates, modern AEAD ciphers, PKCS#11 and TPM hardware support,
password hashing, and post quantum crypto schemes. A Python binding is included,
and several other `language bindings
<https://github.com/randombit/botan/wiki/Language-Bindings>`_ are available.
The library is accompanied by a featureful
`command line interface <https://botan.randombit.net/handbook/cli.html>`_.

See the `documentation <https://botan.randombit.net/handbook>`_ for more
information about included features.

Development is coordinated on `GitHub <https://github.com/randombit/botan>`__
and contributions are welcome. If you need help, please open an issue on
`GitHub <https://github.com/randombit/botan/issues>`__.

If you think you have found a security issue, see the `security page
<https://botan.randombit.net/security.html>`_ for contact information.
