<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This component is an STL-like template class which implements a
directed-graph data structure. A directed graph is a graph in which all arcs
have a direction associated with them - so can be interrogated as to which node
they come from and which they go to.</p>

<p>This document assumes you know what a graph is and only deals with how to use
the digraph class.</p>


<h2 id="instantiation">Instantiation</h2>

<p>The digraph template takes two types:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
template&lt;typename NT, typename AT&gt; class digraph
</pre>

<p>The first type is the type to be stored on the nodes of the graph, whilst the
second is the type to be stored on the arcs (yes, you can store data on the
arcs!). You must specify both types - so if you are not going to be storing data
on, say, the arcs, then it is recommended that you put a bool or a char in that
space, since these are the smallest types. Sadly, you cannot use void as a
zero-byte type here (shame!).</p>

<p>For example, here is how to create a variable called graph which is a digraph
with a string on the node and an int on the arc:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
digraph&lt;string,int&gt; graph;
</pre>


<h2 id="basics">Basics - Nodes, Arcs and Iterators</h2>

<p>The digraph class is written in the style of all STL containers. It is a
templatised class which is traversed and manipulated using iterators. The main
difference with digraph is that it contains two different kinds of object - the
node and the arc - and each one has its own iterator. The convention throughout
the class is to place the prefix arc_ on any function or iterator which acts on
an arc, but there is no prefix on node functions or iterators. Thus, the
following four iterators are provided:</p>

<ul>
<li>iterator - a node iterator</li>
<li>const_iterator - a node iterator for const graphs</li>
<li>arc_iterator - an arc iterator</li>
<li>const_arc_iterator - an arc iterator for const graphs</li>
</ul>

<p>The iterators act very much like list iterators - they can be traversed
forwards using the ++ operator from the begin() to the end() to visit every node
or arc in the graph. The traversal order, however, is undefined. You may find it
is the creation order but this is a coincidence and may change if I redesign the
class, so do not rely on this coincidence in your code.</p>

<p>Thus, to visit every node, you use a standard iteration loop, STL-style:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
for (digraph&lt;string,int&gt;::iterator node = graph.begin(); node != graph.end(); node++)
  std::cerr &lt;&lt; *node &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</pre>

<p>The other point about this loop is that the graph's node type (NT), in this
case a string, is accessed by simply dereferencing the iterator as if it was a
pointer, as with any other STL iterator.</p>

<p>The iterators remain valid when you add nodes to a graph - again, like the
list class. Furthermore, removing nodes only invalidates iterators pointing to
the removed node. However, be aware that deleting a node also deletes all arcs
attached to it. You cannot have unconnected arcs in a digraph.</p>

<p>A similar loop can be used to visit all the arcs in the graph:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
for (digraph&lt;string,int&gt;::arc_iterator arc = graph.arc_begin(); arc != graph.arc_end(); arc++)
  std::cerr &lt;&lt; *arc &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</pre>

<p>Note that the arc_iterator and the access functions arc_begin() and arc_end()
have the arc_ prefix. In this case, dereferencing the arc_iterator returns the
NA type, in this case an int.</p>

<p>When an iterator is first declared, but not assigned to, it is known as a <em>null</em>
iterator. Then, when it is assigned to so that it points to a node in the tree, it is known as a
<em>valid</em> iterator. If the iterator is made to point off the edge of the tree - for example the
parent of the root node, then it becomes an <em>end</em> iterator.</p>

<p>This concept is similar to STL iterators like the list iterator, where an iterator that walks off
the end of the list becomes an end iterator. However, the STL has no concept of a null iterator and
therefore no direct equivalent of a valid iterator.</p>

<p>The iterator has a set of functions for testing these
conditions:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
bool iterator::null(void) const;
bool iterator::end(void) const;
bool iterator::valid(void) const;
</pre>

<p>Note that these functions are members of the iterator class, not the digraph
class.</p>

<p>Exactly one of these conditions will always be true, since the iterator must be one of null, end
or valid.</p>

<p>Only a valid iterator can be dereferenced to access the node type T pointed to by the iterator.
Any attempt to dereference an end or null iterator will result in an exception being thrown. See the
section below on <a href="#exceptions">Exceptions</a> to see which.</p>

<p>STLplus iterators are slightly different to STL iterators in that
  they know which graph object they belong to. The graph is referred
  to as the "owner" of the iterator. An iterator can only be used with
  it's owner. Using an iterator with the wrong graph throws an
  exception (specifically, the stlplus::wrong_object exception).</p>

<p>You can test whether a graph owns an iterator with the owns method:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
bool digraph::owns(iterator);
</pre>

<h2 id="supplementary">Supplementary Data Types</h2>

<p>Many of the functions in digraph return data structures or take data
structures as arguments. These data structures are all STL vectors of iterators
or other data structures. This section simply defines these types and explains
how they are used.</p>

<h3>arc_vector and const_arc_vector</h3>

<pre class="cpp">
typedef std::vector&lt;arc_iterator&gt; arc_vector;
typedef std::vector&lt;const_arc_iterator&gt; const_arc_vector;
</pre>

<p>An arc_vector is a collection of arcs, used to represent either the set of
arcs entering or leaving a node or a path between nodes. When used in the first
form - as a set of arcs - the ordering is irrelevant, it should be treated just
as a set. When used as a path, the ordering is significant because it represents
the sequence of arcs that need to be traversed to get from one node to the
other.</p>

<p>Note that a const_arc_vector is a vector of const_arc_iterator: it does not
mean that the vector itself is constant.</p>

<p>To convert a const_arc_vector to an arc_vector or vice versa, two functions
are provided:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
const_arc_vector constify(const arc_vector&amp;) const;
arc_vector deconstify(const const_arc_vector&amp;) const;
</pre>

<p>So, the constify function adds the const_ to the data type, whilst the
deconstify function removes it.</p>

<h3>path_vector and const_path_vector</h3>

<p>A path_vector is a set of paths, each of which is a set of arcs represented
as an arc_vector as defined
above. So this means that a path_vector is a vector of vectors of arc_iterator.
The type declarations are:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
typedef std::vector&lt;arc_vector&gt; path_vector;
typedef std::vector&lt;const_arc_vector&gt; const_path_vector;
</pre>

<p>These types are only used to store paths as the name suggests. In this case
the vector is again acting as a set in that there is no particular ordering to
the paths. For example, the all_paths function returns a path_vector containing
all the paths between two nodes in no particular order.</p>

<p>As before, the const and non-const forms can be inter-converted.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
const_path_vector constify(const path_vector&amp;) const;
path_vector deconstify(const const_path_vector&amp;) const;
</pre>

<h3>node_vector and const_node_vector</h3>

<p>A node vector is a collection of nodes. Again, it is most usually treated as
a set of nodes. For example, the adjacent_inputs function gives the set of all
nodes connected to the inputs of a node as a node_vector. The declarations are:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
typedef std::vector&lt;iterator&gt; node_vector;
typedef std::vector&lt;const_iterator&gt; const_node_vector;
const_node_vector constify(const node_vector&amp;) const;
node_vector deconstify(const const_node_vector&amp;) const;
</pre>

<h3>arc_select_fn</h3>

<p>This final supplementary type declaration in digraph is a bit different
because it represents the type of a callback function:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
typedef bool (*arc_select_fn) (const digraph&lt;NT,AT&gt;&amp;, const_arc_iterator);
</pre>

<p>The arc_select_fn type defines the type profile for an 'arc select' function
which is used in the path algorithms to restrict the search for paths to a set
of arcs. Basically, the select function is called for each arc which is
considered a candidate for a path. If the select function returns true, then the
arc is traversed in trying to form a path. If, however, the select function
returns false, the arc will be ignored and therefore cannot form part of a
path.</p>

<p>The arguments to the select function are the graph and an arc iterator. If
the arc is tagged with selection information, that information can be accessed
by simply dereferencing the arc iterator. For instance, say we have an arc type
that has a select() member function that returns a bool to indicate whether that
arc is selected. Then the select function would be written like this:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
bool select_arc(const digraph&lt;my_node,my_arc&gt;&amp; graph,digraph&lt;my_node,my_arc&gt;::const_arc_iterator arc)
{
  return arc-&gt;select();
}
</pre>

<p>Sometimes the selection
information is on the nodes instead. Since the select function has access to the
graph as well as the iterator, it is possible to access either the <em>to</em> or
the <em>from</em> nodes of the arc and retrieve the selection information from
there. For example, lets say we have a node data structure with a member
function called select() which simply returns a bool. Lets also say that an arc
is selected only if it is connected <em>to</em> a selected node. This is how you'd
write the selection function:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
bool select_arc_from_node(const digraph&lt;my_node,my_arc&gt;&amp; graph,digraph&lt;my_node,my_arc&gt;::const_arc_iterator arc)
{
  return graph.arc_to(arc)-&gt;select();
}
</pre>

<p>Once you have defined a select function, it can be used as the final argument
in any of the path functions. If you omit the function or set the pointer
(because the arc_select_fn type defines a function pointer) to null, then all
arcs are selected. To pass a function pointer as an argument, simply use the
name of the function with no parentheses. For example:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
digraph&lt;my_node,my_arc&gt;::path_vector paths = graph.all_paths(from,to,select_arc_from_node);
</pre>


<h2 id="graph">Whole Graph Operations</h2>

<p>The only operations on a whole graph are the copy constructor, assignment and
the clear function:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
digraph(const digraph&lt;NT,AT&gt;&amp;);
digraph&lt;NT,AT&gt;&amp; operator=(const digraph&lt;NT,AT&gt;&amp;);
void clear(void);
</pre>

<p>The copy constructor and assignment both make copies of the graph,
maintaining the connectivity of the arcs. Clever huh? The clear function, as its
name suggests, trashes the entire contents of the graph.</p>


<h2 id="nodes">Basic Node Functions</h2>

<h3>Creating a Node - insert</h3>

<p>Usually the first function you will use apart from the constructors. You create a node using the insert
member function which takes as its argument the NT type of the graph - in this
example a string. The return value of the insert function is an iterator pointing
to the newly created node. This can then be used as an argument for the
arc_insert function - see later.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
iterator insert(const NT&amp; node_data);
</pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
digraph&lt;string,int&gt;::iterator node1 = graph.insert("node1");
digraph&lt;string,int&gt;::iterator node2 = graph.insert("node2");
</pre>

<h3>Deleting a Node - erase</h3>

<p>When a node is tired of life, or when you believe a node's misdemeanors
justify euthanasia, you delete it using the erase function:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
iterator erase(iterator);
</pre>

<p>The iterator passed to the erase function is invalidated by the erasure, as
are any other iterators pointing to that node. The erase function returns the
iterator to the next node in the iteration sequence or end() if it is the last
one. This is so that you can continue an iteration even after erasing a node
(again, this is just like the list). For example:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
for (digraph&lt;string,int&gt;::iterator node = graph.begin(); node != graph.end(); )
{
  if (&lt;some condition&gt;)
    node = graph.erase(node);
  else
    node++;
}
</pre>

<p>Note that there is no increment in the for loop control part, but the
increment is deferred to the body of the loop. If the node is deleted, then the
return iterator from the erase function is the next node, otherwise the ++
operator is used to increment to the next node.</p>

<p>Deleting a node also deletes all arcs connected to it. It is illegal to have
unconnected arcs in a digraph.</p>

<h3>Deleting all Nodes - clear</h3>

<p>When a digraph is full of junk, just delete all the nodes using the clear
function. Since deleting a node deletes all arcs connected to it, this function
has the side-effect of deleting all arcs too.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
void clear(void);
</pre>

<h3>Counting Nodes - empty and size</h3>

<p>Sometimes you need to know whether a graph has any nodes in it and if so, how
many. Easy - just use one or both of these two functions:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
bool empty(void) const;
unsigned size(void) const;
</pre>

<p>These functions have no other use - the digraph is not like a vector, so you
cannot get a node by its unsigned offset. Note that empty() is not equivalent to
size()==0 in terms of performance (it is of course logically equivalent). The
empty() function is more efficient.</p>

<h3>Iterators - begin and end</h3>

<p>The use of iterators has already been covered. The first and last nodes in
the iteration sequence are obtained using the begin() and end() functions:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
const_iterator begin(void) const;
iterator begin(void);
const_iterator end(void) const;
iterator end(void);
</pre>

<p>Note that these functions have been overloaded so that begin() on a const
digraph gives you a const_iterator whereas a begin() on a non-const digraph just
gives you an iterator. You need to match the iterator to the context. For
example, when passing a digraph to a function which cannot modify it, the
convention is to pass it as a const reference. Therefore, within that function,
only const_iterator can be used. This const_iterator can only be used to iterate
through the graph or to access the contents of a node by dereferencing - and
even then it returns a const reference to the contents so you cannot modify the
node data. Here's an example function which prints the nodes of a graph and
shows how the const-ness is preserved:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
void print_nodes(const digraph&lt;string,int&gt;&amp; graph)
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "  empty: " &lt;&lt; graph.empty() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "  size: " &lt;&lt; graph.size() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  for (digraph&lt;string,int&gt;::const_iterator node = graph.begin(); node != graph.end(); node++)
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "    - " &lt;&lt; *node;
}
</pre>

<p>Sometimes you need to store an iterator in another data structure - it is
recommended that you always store an iterator and not a const_iterator. The
problem then is that you might actually want it to be a const_iterator. It is
possible to convert between iterator and const_iterator by using the constify
and deconstify methods of the iterator class (Notice that they are methods of
the iterator, not the digraph):</p>

<pre class="cpp">
const_iterator iterator::constify(void) const;
iterator const_iterator::deconstify(void) const;
</pre>

<p>In use, you use them like this:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
digraph&lt;string,int&gt;::iterator i = ...;
digraph&lt;string,int&gt;::const_iterator ci = i.constify();
</pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
digraph&lt;string,int&gt;::const_iterator ci = ...;
digraph&lt;string,int&gt;::iterator i = ci.deconstify();
</pre>

<h3>Arc access - fanin, input, fanout, output</h3>

<p>The digraph class implements a directed graph, so the arcs connected to each
node are split into two groups - the inputs and outputs. There can be any number
of inputs and outputs to a node. The number of inputs to a node is the node's
fanin and the number of outputs its fanout. Inputs and outputs are acccessed by
their integer offset. The following functions are provided for inputs:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
unsigned fanin(const_iterator) const;
unsigned fanin(iterator);
const_arc_iterator input(const_iterator, unsigned) const;
arc_iterator input(iterator, unsigned);
</pre>

<p>The fanin function gives the number of inputs, which can then be used in a
loop which counts from 0 to fanin-1. i.e.:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; graph.fanin(node); i++)
{
  arc_iterator arc = graph.input(node, i);
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>Note that an arc_iterator is retrieved from a non-const digraph, whilst a
const_arc_iterator is retrieved from a const digraph.</p>

<p>Similarly, the following set of functions can be used to access the output
arcs of a node:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
unsigned fanout(const_iterator) const;
unsigned fanout(iterator);
const_arc_iterator output(const_iterator, unsigned) const;
arc_iterator output(iterator, unsigned);
</pre>

<h3>Arc access - inputs, outputs</h3>

<p>Another way of obtaining the inputs and outputs of a node is as an arc vector.
The type declaration for arc_vector is a member of digraph and there are two
functions inputs(node) and outputs(node) to get these lists. The function
profiles are:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
arc_vector inputs(const_iterator) const;
arc_vector outputs(const_iterator) const;
</pre>

<p>Once you have an arc_vector, it can be iteratoed through using the STL list
iterator. Remember that each arc in the arc_vector is represented by an arc
iterator, so the arc itself is accessed by dereferencing that iterator.</p>

<h3>Arc access - input_offset, output_offset</h3>

<p>The remaining arc access functions are utility functions that allow you to
find the fanin or fanout index of an arc from a node.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
unsigned output_offset(const_iterator from, const_arc_iterator arc) const;
unsigned output_offset(iterator from, arc_iterator arc);
unsigned input_offset(const_iterator to, const_arc_iterator arc) const;
unsigned input_offset(iterator to, arc_iterator arc);
</pre>

<p>The value returned is an index in the range 0..fanin-1 for inputs,
0..fanout-1 for outputs. If the arc is not an input or output of the specified
node, then the value npos() is returned (that is, digraph&lt;NT,AT&gt;::npos()).
Don't blame me for the name, I adopted the name used in the STL string template
which serves a similar purpose.</p>


<h2 id="arcs">Basic Arc Functions</h2>

<p>To avoid name conflicts, arc functions have the arc_ prefix. Arcs, like
nodes, are referred to by a list iterator which is returned by the arc_insert
function. They may also be visited from arc_begin() to arc_end(). Each arc has a
<em>from</em> field and a <em>to</em> field which contain the node iterators of the endpoints of
the arc. Of course, the arc data can be accessed by simply dereferencing the
iterator.</p>

<h3>Creating an Arc - arc_insert</h3>

<p>An arc is created using the arc_insert function. Since it is illegal to have
an unconnected arc in a digraph, the nodes it is connected to must be created
first. Then the arc is connected at the time of its creation by passing the node
iterators to the arc_insert function. Since arcs have a direction, the nodes it
is connected to are referred to as the <em>from</em> node and the <em>to</em> node.
The final argument of the arc_insert function is the data to be stored on the
arc. Since it is common to store data only on the nodes and not on the arcs, the
arc data field is optional:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
arc_iterator arc_insert(iterator from, iterator to, const AT&amp; arc_data = AT());
</pre>

<p>As with the node iterator, the returned arc_iterator points to the
newly-created arc.</p>

<h3>Deleting an Arc - arc_erase</h3>

<p>An arc is deleted using the arc_erase function. As with the node erase
function, it returns an arc_iterator to the next arc in the iteration
sequence:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
arc_iterator arc_erase(arc_iterator);
</pre>

<p>Deleting the last arc connected to a node does <strong>not</strong> cause the node to
be deleted - it is perfectly legal to have floating nodes in a digraph.</p>

<h3>Deleting all Arcs - arc_clear</h3>

<p>Obvious really:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
void arc_clear(void);
</pre>

<p>This leaves all the nodes in the digraph floating aimlessly in the void.</p>

<h3>Counting Arcs - arc_empty, arc_size</h3>

<p>The number of arcs can be obtained with the arc_size function or
alternatively, the special case of zero arcs can be tested for with the
arc_empty function:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
bool arc_empty (void) const;
unsigned arc_size(void) const;
</pre>

<p>As with the node functions, remember that it is more efficient to test for
empty() than to test for size()==0 and that !empty() is more efficient than
size()&gt;0.</p>

<h3>Arc Iterators - arc_begin, arc_end</h3>

<p>The first and last arcs in the iteration sequence are obtained using the
arc_begin() and arc_end() functions:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
const_arc_iterator arc_begin(void) const;
arc_iterator arc_begin(void);
const_arc_iterator arc_end(void) const;
arc_iterator arc_end(void);
</pre>

<p>You then step through the arcs using the ++ operator on the iterator.</p>

<p>Note that these functions have been overloaded so that arc_begin() on a const
digraph gives you a const_arc_iterator whereas an arc_begin() on a non-const
digraph just gives you an arc_iterator, just as with nodes. Here's an example
function which prints the arcs of a graph and shows how the const-ness is
preserved:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
void print_arcs(const digraph&lt;string,int&gt;&amp; graph)
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "  empty: " &lt;&lt; graph.arc_empty() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "  size: " &lt;&lt; graph.arc_size() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  for (digraph&lt;string,int&gt;::const_arc_iterator arc = graph.arc_begin(); arc != graph.arc_end(); arc++)
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "    - " &lt;&lt; *arc &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</pre>

<h3>Node Access - arc_from, arc_to</h3>

<p>You can go from an arc to its connected nodes using the arc_from and arc_to
functions. Remember that an arc is directed and so goes <em>from</em> a node
<em>to</em> another. The arc_from function, obviously (Doh) gives the <em>from</em>
node and so on...</p>

<pre class="cpp">
const_iterator arc_from(const_arc_iterator) const;
iterator arc_from(arc_iterator);
const_iterator arc_to(const_arc_iterator) const;
iterator arc_to(arc_iterator);
</pre>

<h3>Changing Arc Connectivity - arc_move, arc_move_from, arc_move_to and arc_flip</h3>

<p>You can change the nodes that an arc is connected to using these
functions.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
void arc_move(arc_iterator arc, iterator from, iterator to);
void arc_move_from(arc_iterator arc, iterator from);
void arc_move_to(arc_iterator arc, iterator to);
void arc_flip(arc_iterator arc);
</pre>

<p>The arc_move function disconnects the arc from its current from/to nodes and reconnects
to a new from/to pair. The arc_move_from function only changes the from node of the
arc, leaving the to node untouched. Similarly the arc_move_to function only
changes the to node and leaves the from node untouched. Finally, the arc_flip
function swaps the from and to nodes so as to flip the arc's direction.</p>

<h2 id="whole">Whole Graph Methods</h2>

<p>The whole-graph operations allow large-scale manipulations of
graphs. At present there is only one whole-graph operation:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
void move(digraph&amp; source);
</pre>

<p>This moves the source graph's nodes and arcs into the target
graph. The source will be left empty by this move. All iterators to
the source graph will become owned by the target graph, so the
iterators will continue working and pointing to the same node or arc.</p>

<h2 id="adjacency">Adjacency Functions</h2>

<p>Nodes are adjacent if they are connected by an arc. Since digraph is a
directed graph, the direction of the arc is significant. For example, if there
is an arc from London to Manchester, London is considered adjacent to Manchester,
but Manchester is not considered adjacent to London (a principle well
understood by the owner of Virgin trains). The following functions
allow operations on adjacent nodes. They are simply composite oprations which
combine basic node and arc access functions to give a slightly more abstract
approach. To put it another way, you can manipulate nodes without having to go
via arcs all the time.</p>

<h3>Adjacency test - adjacent, adjacent_arc, adjacent_arcs</h3>

<p>The first function is the test for whether two nodes are adjacent:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
bool adjacent(const_iterator from, const_iterator to) const;
bool adjacent(iterator from, iterator to);
</pre>

<p>The next set of functions find which arc makes two nodes adjacent. There is
no need to test for adjacency first though, because if the lookup fails, these
functions simply return arc_end().</p>

<pre class="cpp">
const_arc_iterator adjacent_arc(const_iterator from, const_iterator to) const;
arc_iterator adjacent_arc(iterator from, iterator to);
</pre>

<p>There may be any number of arcs connecting two nodes. The following functions return the set of
all arcs connecting two nodes. If there are no arcs then the return vector will be zero length.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
const_arc_vector adjacent_arcs(const_iterator from, const_iterator to) const;
arc_vector adjacent_arcs(iterator from, iterator to);
</pre>

<h3>Adjacency sets - input_adjacencies, output_adjacencies</h3>

<p>The final set of functions access the set of nodes adjacent to a particular
node as a node list. This list can then be traversed using the normal STL list
iterators.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
const_node_vector input_adjacencies(const_iterator to) const;
node_vector input_adjacencies(iterator to);
const_node_vector output_adjacencies(const_iterator from) const;
node_vector output_adjacencies(iterator from);
</pre>


<h2 id="sort">Topographical Sort Algorithms</h2>

<p>A topographical sort is an ordering of a graph's nodes such that each node is visited after all
of its inputs have been visited. It is purely a function of the connectivity of the graph and
nothing to do with the data sored in the graph.</p>

<p>There are four methods provided for this:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
std::pair&lt;const_node_vector,const_arc_vector&gt; sort(arc_select_fn = 0) const;
std::pair&lt;node_vector,arc_vector&gt; sort(arc_select_fn = 0);

const_node_vector dag_sort(arc_select_fn = 0) const;
node_vector dag_sort(arc_select_fn = 0);
</pre>

<p>The <code>sort</code> methods are the full form of the algorithm. It returns two vectors: the
first is the sorted set of node iterators in topographical order. The second is the set of iterators
to error arcs: these are the arcs that had to be broken to perform the sort. This is because the
sort is otherwise impossible in the presence of loops - you cannot visit every node after all of its
inputs. If the error arcs vector is empty, that means the graph had no loops and is a Directed
Acyclic Graph or DAG.</p>

<p>The <code>dag_sort</code> methods are for cases where you already know that a graph is a DAG, for
example because of the way it was constructed. In that case the extra checking of the error arcs is
unnecessary. This returns a vector of node iterators in topographical order. If it turns out that
the graph is not a DAG (i.e. there are loops), it returns an empty vector.</p>

<h3>Arc selection callback</h3>

<p>The sort methods just presented and all the path algorithms in later sections take an arc_select
callback which allows arcs to be selected or ignored for consideration in the sort or path. The
selection callback function is applied to each arc in the traversal. If no function is provided
(i.e. a null pointer is passed, which is the default) all of the arcs in the graph are selected.</p>

<p>If you want to use arc selection you should create a function with the type profile given by the
arc_select_fn type. The select function is passed both the graph and the arc iterator so that it is
possible to select an arc on the basis of the nodes it is connected to. Within the function, write
code that returns false if the arc is to be ignored and true when selected.</p>

<p>For example, consider a graph with an integer value on each arc:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
typedef digraph&lt;string,int&gt; sgraph;
</pre>

<p>You could make forward ards natural and backward arcs negative. The following selection callback
will then select only the forward arcs:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
bool select_natural (const sgraph&amp; graph, sgraph::const_arc_iterator arc)
{
  return *arc &gt;= 0;
}
</pre>

<p>This is applied by using the function name as a parameter to the sort methods:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
sgraph::node_vector sort = graph.dag_sort(select_natural);
</pre>

<p>After this call, the node vector will be the topographical sort order of the forward arcs only.</p>

<p>Note: I used a callback because the STL-like predicate idea wasn't working
for me... I kept hitting against the limitations of templates, or at least their
limitations as implemented by gcc and by VC++.</p>


<h2 id="paths">Path Algorithms</h2>

<p>A path is a series of arcs - you can use arc_from and arc_to to convert
that into a series of nodes. The arc_from of the first arc in the path is the
start node of the path, whilst the arc_to of the last arc is the end node of the
path. A path must have at least one arc in it, but an empty arc_vector can be
returned by some of these functions to indicate an error.</p>

<p>As with the topographical sorts in the last section, arcs can be selected or ignored as
candidates for forming paths by using a select callback which is passed as an optional parameter to
all of the path functions.</p>

<h3>Paths between two nodes - path_exists, all_paths</h3>

<p>The simplest path function is the test of whether two nodes are connected by
a path:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
bool path_exists(const_iterator from, const_iterator to, arc_select_fn = 0) const;
bool path_exists(iterator from, iterator to, arc_select_fn = 0);
</pre>

<p>Nuff said?</p>

<p>You can also get the set of all paths between two nodes.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
const_path_vector all_paths(const_iterator from, const_iterator to, arc_select_fn = 0) const;
path_vector all_paths(iterator from, iterator to, arc_select_fn = 0);
</pre>

<p>The return value is a vector of paths, where an empty return vector means that there are no paths
between the nodes.</p>

<p>Note: path_exists() is faster than calling all_paths() and
then checking for an empty result. However, calling both functions is only a
good idea if there is a high false rate expected. In other words if you write
this:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
...
if (graph.path_exists(from,to))
{
  digraph&lt;my_node,my_arc&gt;::path_vector paths = graph.all_paths(from,to);
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>This is worthwhile if there are few paths so that the path_exists nearly
always returns false, but inefficient if the path is likely to exist. In that
case it is better to rewrite:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
...
digraph&lt;my_node,mo_arc&gt;::path_vector paths = graph.all_paths(from,to);
if (!paths.empty())
{
  ...
}
</pre>

<h3>Paths to/from a single node - reachable_nodes, reaching_nodes</h3>

<p>The next set of path algorithms are functions which calculate the set of all
nodes in the graph which are reachable from a particular node (i.e. there exists
an output path) and a complementary set which calculate the set of nodes which
can reach that node (i.e. there exists a path to the node's inputs). I refer to
the former set as the reachable nodes and the latter as the reaching nodes.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
const_node_vector reachable_nodes(const_iterator from, arc_select_fn = 0) const;
node_vector reachable_nodes(iterator from, arc_select_fn = 0);
const_node_vector reaching_nodes(const_iterator to, arc_select_fn = 0) const;
node_vector reaching_nodes(iterator to, arc_select_fn = 0);
</pre>

<h3>Shortest paths - shortest_path, shortest_paths</h3>

<p>The shortest path algorithms analyse the paths between nodes and calculate
the shortest. This is an unweighted algorith which simply counts the number of
arcs to get the path length. However, it is more efficient than calling
all_nodes and then selecting the shortest.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
const_arc_vector shortest_path(const_iterator from, const_iterator to, arc_select_fn = 0) const;
arc_vector shortest_path(iterator from, iterator to, arc_select_fn = 0);
</pre>

<p>The functions return a single path. If that path is empty, then no paths were
found between the nodes specified. Otherwise, the size of the vector is the path
length.</p>

<p>A variant of the shortest path function is the shortest_paths function
(notice the plural). This calculates the set of all reachable nodes form the
specified node and then calculates the shortest path for each of those nodes.
The algorithm is, however, more efficient than calling reachable_nodes followed
by repeated calls to shortest_path.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
const_path_vector shortest_paths(const_iterator from, arc_select_fn = 0) const;
path_vector shortest_paths(iterator from, arc_select_fn = 0);
</pre>

<p>The result is a vector of paths in no particular order. To find which
reachable node each path referes to, you can find the arc_to node of the last
arc in the path. There is one path in the path_vector for each reachable nodes,
so the set of arc_to nodes for the path_vector is also the set of all reachable
nodes.</p>

<h2 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h2>

<p>There are three exceptions that can be thrown by digraph, all indicating a
misuse of the iterators:</p>

<dl>

<dt><strong>null_dereference</strong> - logic_error</dt>

<dd>This is used to indicate that an iterator which is null has been dereferenced. You should always
be sure that iterators are non-null before using the <code>*</code> or <code>-&gt;</code>
operators.</dd>

<dt><strong>end_dereference</strong> - logic_error</dt>

<dd>This is used to indicate that an iterator that is pointing to an end element has been
dereferenced. In line with STL conventions, the end iterator points to the element after the last
element in a container, so dereferencing such an iterator is illegal (the memory pointed to will be
unconstructed).</dd>

<dt><strong>wrong_object</strong> - logic_error</dt>

<dd>This is used to indicate that an iterator which was created by one container has been used in a
different container. For example, if you have two graph objects in your program, create an iterator
from one graph and then use it in another, then this will throw the wrong_object exception.</dd>

</dl>

<p>These exceptions are common to all STLplus iterators and are explained in
the STLplus <a href="exceptions.html">exceptions policy</a>.</p>
