<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The STLplus library collection is intended to be portable between operating
systems and compilers. At present, this means Windows/Unix/MacOSX systems and
Gnu gcc/Microsoft/Borland compilers. Whether this will be extended to other
operating systems and compilers is a moot point, since the library requires a
good implementation of C++ templates.</p>

<p>In all cases you need to unpack the software into a directory which from
now on will be referred to as "the STLplus3 directory". This directory contains
a subdirectory for each of the libraries (e.g. "containers") and a subdirectory for the
documentation in "docs" and error messages in "messages".</p>

<p>The simplest approach is to simply build all of the libraries - using libraries stand-alone takes
a bit more work.</p>

<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>

<p>As far as is reasonable, the STLplus libraries have been designed to be used separately. However,
some of the libraries use the STLplus containers and portability libraries to make them easier to
code and to make them portable too. Also, two of the libraries (persistence and strings) provide
additional functionality for the containers and portability libraries and therefore depend on them. 
The following table lists the dependencies:</p>

<table cellspacing="0">
<caption>Dependencies between STLplus libraries</caption>
<thead>
<tr><th scope="col">Library</th><th scope="col">Depends on</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>containers</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>persistence</td><td><i>containers</i>, <i>portability</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>portability</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>subsystems</td><td><b>containers</b>, <b>portability</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>strings</td><td><i>containers</i>, <i>portability</i></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The <b>bold</b> dependencies are required, or <b>hard</b> dependencies. If a library has a hard
dependency, then you cannot use it stand-alone - you must incorporate both the library and all of
its hard dependencies into your project.</p>

<p>The <i>italicised</i> dependencies are optional, or <i>soft</i> dependencies. They are on by
default, but can be switched off if the required library is not installed. For example, if you want
to use the persistence library as a stand-alone library for making C++ types persistent but are not
interested in the containers library, then that can be done.</p>

<p>The key to building a library without the soft dependency on the containers library is to build
using the following compiler directive:</p>

<dl>

<dt>-D NO_STLPLUS_CONTAINERS</dt>

<dd>Builds the library without the dependency on the containers library. All features provided by
the containers library will be disabled.</dd>

<dt>-D NO_STLPLUS_INF</dt>

<dd>Builds the library without the dependency on the portability/inf type which in turn removes the
dependency on the portability library. All features provided by the inf type will be disabled.</dd>

</dl>

<p>These compiler directives must be used to build the library - for example, to make the
portability library stand-alone, build it with these compiler directives. The same directives must
also be used to build any file in your program that includes headers from the library. The
simplest way to do this is to enable the directives for the whole project.</p>

<h2 id="monolithic">Monolithic Build</h2>

<p>You can merge the libraries together into one large library - known as a monolithic build of
STLplus. The simplest way of doing this is to use a shell - DOS shell on Windows, bash shell on
Gnu/Linux or other Unix - and cd to the <code>stlplus3/source</code> directory. There, run the script
<code>make_monolithic</code>. This copies all of the source code into the directory. Then you will
find there are alternative project files and build scripts in the source directory to allow you to
use STLplus as a monolithic library.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Monolithic build has the header
  file <code>stlplus3.hpp</code> which includes the whole library collection in
  one go.</p>

<p>The rest of the documentation is based on the assumption that you are using STLplus as a library
collection, but should be easy to relate to the use of the monolithic build instead.</p>

<h2 id="makefiles">Gnu Gcc Using My Makefiles</h2>

<h3>About my Make System</h3>

<p>If you are using Gnu gcc as your compiler, then I supply a set of make rules with
STLplus that will not only build this project but any other projects you are using too. In
each of the STLplus source directories is a <code>Makefile</code>. This is usually quite small. The
simplest <code>Makefile</code> contains the following:</p>

<pre class="script">
include ../../makefiles/gcc.mak
</pre>

<p>The <code>makefiles</code> module is required and can be downloaded from the same place that you
got the STLplus library. It contains the <code>gcc.mak</code> makefile rules which automatically
adjust to any project provided that it is organised in a certain way.</p>

<p>The STLplus Makefile assumes that the <code>makefiles</code> module is in the same parent
directory as the <code>stlplus3</code> module. This is recommended, but if you wish to
use a different configuration, you will need to edit the include path in the Makefile to reflect
the change.</p>

<p>At the top level of the STLplus library collection is another Makefile which will build
all of the libraries in one go. It contains the following:</p>

<pre class="script">
include ../../makefiles/subdirectories.mak
</pre>

<p>The <code>subdirectories.mak</code> rules simply call make recursively on each
subdirectory which contains a <code>Makefile</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>makefiles</code> module is a generic build system which provides a standard set of make
rules for compiling and linking virtually any libraries and applications. It is not specific to
STLplus. You are free to use it as the build system for your own projects if you prefer. It is
designed to be as simple as possible to use whilst allowing multi-library projects and different
build configurations - it currently supports a Debug build, a Release build and a Gprof (code
profiling) build. You do not have to use it of course - you can write your own Makefile. However,
you are recommended to use these makefiles to build STLplus.</p>

<h3>Building with my Make System</h3>

<p>To build the STLplus library collection, first start a command-line shell. Then change
directory to the STLplus3 directory. Then simply run one of the following
commands:</p>

<dl>

<dt>make</dt>
<dd>Builds a debug library</dd>

<dt>make RELEASE=on</dt>
<dd>Builds a release library</dd>

<dt>make GPROF=on</dt>
<dd>Builds a code profiling library (using gprof)</dd>

</dl>

<p>You can build all three of these variants of the library without them interfering since the
object files are stored in separate subdirectories for each build.</p>

<p>In all three cases the build creates an archive which is called lib&lt;library&gt;.a, where
&lt;library&gt; is the name of the library - e.g. libportability.a for the portability library. This
is stored in a subdirectory of the library directory which is build-specific. Refer to the <a
href="porting.html#progress">porting</a> page and look for the Build Name column in the table. As an example,
the build for DEC Alpha running Gnu/Linux has the Build Name <code>GNU-alpha</code>. This then has an extra
suffix added depending on the variant:</p>

<dl>
<dt>-debug</dt><dd>for the debug variant</dd>
<dt>-release</dt><dd>for the release variant</dd>
<dt>-gprof</dt><dd>for the gprof variant</dd>
</dl>

<p>So, for example, the debug variant of the DEC Alpha build will be stored in a subdirectory called
  <code>GNU-alpha-debug</code>.</p>

<p>When you use my makefile system in a multi-library project, the make system will automatically
select the correct version of <code>lib&lt;library&gt;.a</code> depending on the configuration
chosen for the build. For example, if you build an application dependent on the portability library
and you are on a DEC Alpha platform and building the debug variant, the build system will automatically
link with <code>GNU-alpha-debug/libportability.a</code>.</p>

<h3>Using with my Make System</h3>

<p>Once you have built the STLplus library collection, you can incorporate any of its libraries into
another project. If you want, you can build your own projects with the <code>makefiles</code>
module. However, this is not necessary - see the section on <a href="#general">general
guidelines</a> - Using The Libraries.</p>

<p>To use the STLplus libraries as part of another project, you need to create a Makefile for
that project that will make the stlplus headers available and will link in the appropriate
archive files for each of the libraries that you are using. The recommended way of doing
this is to use the standard gcc.mak makefile provided as part of the makefiles module.</p>

<p>I'll assume that your project is in another directory next to (i.e. at the same level in the
filesystem) as the STLplus directory. I'll also assume you are using the makefiles module and that
this is also installed alongside. Finally, I'll assume that your source code is in a subdirectory of
the project directory, for example in a subdirectory called "source".</p>

<p>Here is an example Makefile to build an object library from source that includes the STLplus
portability and containers libraries:</p>

<pre class="script">
LIBRARIES = ../../stlplus3/portability ../../stlplus3/containers
include ../../makefiles/gcc.mak
</pre>

<p>This is stored in a file called Makefile in the source code directory of
the project.</p>

<p>The LIBRARIES variable is a space-separated list of libraries to include in
the project. It should point to the source code directory of each library, i.e. where the .hpp and
.cpp files are to be found.
The <code>makefiles</code> module's rules will build the current directory and
will add the LIBRARIES as extra include paths during compilation. Since this
Makefile only builds an object library, there is no link step.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> the LIBRARIES variable should list the libraries in their dependency order (see the <a
href="#dependencies">section on dependencies</a>) with the higher-level libraries first
and their required libraries after them. For example, the subsystems library should be listed before
the portability library.</p>

<p>When using this generic makefile, there are some rules to follow to make it
work.</p>

<ul>

<li>Project directories should have the same name as the library.</li>

<li>The project directory may have a subdirectory called source which contains all of the source
code plus the Makefile.</li>

<li>There should be no further sub-directories below the source directory.</li>

<li>All libraries in a project must have unique names.</li>

</ul>

<p>The current directory, i.e. the one containing the Makefile, may be called source, in which case
the directory above that is used as the name of the library. If the current directory is not called
source, then the directory name is taken to be the library name. For example, if you call your
project <code>test</code> and store the source in a folder <code>test/source</code> then the
makefile system will generate an object library called <code>libtest.a</code></p>

<p>To build a program rather than a library requires just one more line to be added to the Makefile.
Here is an example Makefile that builds a program:</p>

<pre class="script">
IMAGE     = client
LIBRARIES = ../../stlplus3/portability ../../stlplus3/containers
include ../../makefiles/gcc.mak
</pre>

<p>The IMAGE variable tells the make system first that a program is being built and second where the
linked program should be placed and what it should be called. In this case there is no path to the
IMAGE so it will be built in the current directory. The name of the program will be client (in fact,
on Windows, client.exe, but the .exe extension should never be specified).</p>

<p>A common variant is to link all programs into a common "bin" directory at
the same level of directory as the library directories. This is two levels up
from the source directory:</p>

<pre class="script">
IMAGE     = ../../bin/client
LIBRARIES = ../../stlplus3/portability ../../stlplus3/containers
include ../../makefiles/gcc.mak
</pre>

<p>The overall directory structure is now:</p>

<ul>
<li class="folder">&lt;parent directory&gt;
<ul>
<li class="folder">bin
<ul>
<li class="file">client.exe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="folder">makefiles
<ul>
<li class="file">gcc.mak</li>
<li class="file">subdirectories.mak</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="folder">stlplus3
<ul>
<li class="folder">portability
<ul>
<li class="file">Makefile</li>
<li class="file">&lt;portability library source files&gt;</li>
<li class="folder">GNU-alpha-debug
<ul>
<li class="file">libportability.a</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="folder">containers
<ul>
<li class="file">Makefile</li>
<li class="file">&lt;containers library source files&gt;</li>
<li class="folder">GNU-alpha-debug
<ul>
<li class="file">libcontainers.a</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="folder">&lt;other stlplus3 libraries&gt;...
</li>
<li class="folder">docs</li>
<li class="folder">messages</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="folder">client
<ul>
<li class="folder">source
<ul>
<li class="file">Makefile</li>
<li class="file">&lt;client program source files&gt;</li>
<li class="folder">GNU-alpha-debug
<ul>
<li class="file">libclient.a</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>One final trick worth noting is that the IMAGE variable can be used to
put different operating system programs into different subdirectories by using the PLATFORM
variable. For example, here's a variant on the Makefile shown earlier for the client program:</p>

<pre class="script">
IMAGE     = ../../bin/${PLATFORM}/client
LIBRARIES = ../../stlplus3/portability ../../stlplus3/containers
include ../../makefiles/gcc.mak
</pre>

<p>This will put Cygwin binaries in ../../bin/CYGWIN and Gnu/Linux binaries into ../../bin/GNULINUX.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the IMAGE variable can put each different build into a different subdirectory by
using the SUBDIR variable instead of PLATFORM. The SUBDIR variable includes a prefix for the
platform and the suffix for the different build configuration, so the debug build will be called
CYGWIN-i686-debug for the Cygwin build and GNU-i686-debug for the Linux build.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft">Microsoft Visual Studio on Windows</h2>

<p>The STLplus library collection can alternatively be built on
Windows using the native Microsoft Visual Studio compiler. The STLplus
library includes a Visual Studio solution for Visual Studio 6
(deprecated), 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2015 Each library in the collection
has its own project file which can be incorporated into any other
workspace or solution. So individual libraries can be incorporated
stand-alone in this way.</p>

<p>Beware that there is a terminology problem here - Microsoft call a library a project and a
project a solution, and so on. I will try to remember to use Microsoft terminology here.</p>

<h3>Building The Libraries</h3>

<p>The STLplus library collection comes with a collection of Visual
Studio Solution and Project files which are kept in a directory called
'ide'. Select the appropriate set of solution and project files for
the version of Visual Studio that you have.</p>

<p>The solution can now be built. This will build all of the libraries
in the collection. First, select the configuration you wish to build -
Debug or Release - and the platform - Win32 or x64. You can build all
of the projects by building the whole solution and it builds all the
projects.</p>

<p>The Debug configuration is for use in debug builds, the Release is
for use in release builds (no debug information). At this stage, if
you wish, you can select other configurations and build them too. Each
configuration is stored separately so they do not overwrite each
other.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> the supplied project file will build STLplus so that
it uses the multi-threaded DLL versions of the C runtime library (msvcrt.dll). 
You may need to adjust the project settings,
either for STLplus or for your application so that all projects use the same
settings. The symptom that will tell you that you have this problem is that,
when you link your application, every symbol in the C runtime library will
result in an error message from the linker saying that it is multiply
defined.</p>

<h3>Using The Libraries</h3>

<p>Once you have built the STLplus library collection, you can then
use it in other projects. This is done by setting up compiler and
linker dependencies. The compiler dependencies give your code access
to the STLplus headers, then the linker dependency brings in the
compiled object code.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> These instructions are for Visual Studio 2015. Other versions are similar but
all the dialogs have been redesigned - the principles however are the same.</p>

<p>To set up these dependencies, select the project that you wish to
have access to the stlplus libraries. Then select the right-click menu
item Properties. A mind-bogglingly complicated dialog will pop up. It
is possible to configure all Configuyrations and Platforms on one
go. To do this, select the Configuration drop-down menu in the top
left and choose All&nbsp;Configurations. Also select the Platform
  dropdown menu and select All&nbsp;Platforms.</p>

<h2 id="mingw">Native build on Windows using MinGW Gnu gcc</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> development environment also allows <em>native</em>
Windows applications to be built using the Gnu compiler. This accesses operating services through
the Windows system calls directly.</p>

<p>The compiler is pre-configured with _WIN32 enabled, so programs and libraries (such as STLplus)
that use this switch will automatically build correctly.</p>

<p>The standard Makefile system I supply will compile out of the box with MinGW if it is run in the MSys
environment.</p>

<h2 id="unix-other">Other Unix builds using Gnu gcc</h2>

<p>STLplus is designed to be portable to any Unix system, well at least any Posix-compliant Unix
system, but this is only true when using the Gnu gcc compiler. Native compilers on the various
flavours of Unix are not supported. This is not a realistic goal when there are so many variations
between compilers.</p>

<p>The only problem you may have is that your version of Unix is not recognised by the makefiles
module. You can test this by running make and seeing if you get an error message.</p>

<p>If you do get an error, you can easily add support for your platform. The key is the first
executable code in the makefiles/gcc.mak file:</p>

<pre class="script">
OS     := $(shell uname -s)

ifneq ($(findstring CYGWIN,$(OS)),)
...
</pre>

<p>This executes the 'uname' system command and then tries to identify the operating system by
recognising a substring of the return value. This is then used to set PLATFORM to a simplified name
for that platform. For example, the current version of Cygwin that I'm using has a uname of
"CYGWIN_NT-5.0". The code shown above recognises the Cygwin build and sets PLATFORM to be the
simplified form "CYGWIN". In general, the PLATFORM value should be a short representation of the
operating system name in uppercase and with no punctuation since it is passed to the compiler as a
macro. Different names should be used for different versions of the operating system that use
different object code and are not binary compatible. Binary compatible versions of an operating
system should be mapped onto the same short name. Thus, support for all Gnu/Linux systems can be handled
by one variant:</p>

<pre class="script">
# Build on Gnu/Linux
ifneq ($(findstring GNU,$(UNAME)),)
PLATFORM  := GNULINUX
endif
</pre>

<p>In fact, support for Gnu/Linux and Solaris has already been added in this way. Further platforms will
be added as I try them.</p>

<p>The PLATFORM name is used as the prefix to the subdirectory used to store object code. Thus the
Cygwin debug build is stored in CYGWIN-i686-debug whilst the Gnu/Linux debug build is stored in
GNU-i686-debug. This organisation means that the same disk can be mounted on different operating
systems and built without the different operating systems conflicting with each other. It also keeps
the different kinds of build (e.g. release or debug) in separate directories.</p>

<p>The PLATFORM value is also passed to the compiler as a macro definition in the form
-D&lt;platform&gt;, where &lt;platform&gt; is the name of the platform (e.g. -DGNU). This means
that if it proves necessary to differentiate between platforms to get any part of the C++ code
working, then this is done by adding "#ifdef GNU" or whatever compiler switches to the code. The
macro _WIN32 is defined for native Windows builds regardless of the compiler - if this is not set
then the default is to assume a vanilla Unix build. To date, only very minor differences have been
found between different Unix platforms. However, if you use a different build system it is a good
idea to pass this parameter to the compiler (e.g. -DGNU) in case future updates to the library do
need to have these switches. Check the ../../makefiles/gcc.mak file for the values currently
supported, even if you don't plan to use my make system.</p>
