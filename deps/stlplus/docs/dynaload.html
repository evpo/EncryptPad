<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>There are two types of library in C++ (and most other language) programs. Archive libraries are
linked into an application at link time. Dynamic libraries are usually linked at load time just
before the application is executed. In the latter case, when the application is linked, you tell the
linker to include a dependency on a dynamic library. Then, at run-time, the operating system links
the dynamic library to the application and runs it. This deferred linkage is done for two main
reasons: to allow the application to use someone else's library and to allow separate programs to
share resources.</p>

<p>However, it is also possible to load dynamic libraries during run-time on demand. In this case,
the application has no dependency on the dynamic library and will start running without it. Indeed,
the dynamic library can be missing. This is a powerful technique for extending applications, for
example to implement plug-ins. Of course, the application will be more complicated because it now
needs to deal with the situation where a dynamic library is missing and handle this error
elegantly.</p>

<p>The STLplus dynaload class manages the run-time loading of dynamic libraries - from now in
referred to as Dynamic Loading. It is just a thin layer which hides platform-specific features.
However, it is in the form of a class so that Dynamic Loading becomes object orientated. Dynamic
libraries can be loaded by constructing a dynaload object, then functions loaded from the library
and called. The library is unloaded by the destructor.</p>

<h2 id="libraries">Library Management</h2>

<p>This section describes the Dynamic Loading aspect of the dynaload class.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
namespace stlplus
{

  class dynaload
  {
  public:

    ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // library management

    // construct the object but do not load
    dynaload(void);

    // construct and load
    dynaload(const std::string&amp; library, const std::string&amp; directory = std::string());

    // destroy and unload if loaded
    ~dynaload(void);

    // load the library - return success or fail
    bool load(const std::string&amp; library, const std::string&amp; directory = std::string());

    // unload the library if loaded
    bool unload(void);

    // test whether the library is loaded
    bool loaded(void) const;

    ...

  };

}
</pre>

<p>The first constructor creates a dynaload object but does not load the dynamic library - this is
used in deferred loading - the library is loaded by calling the load method which has the benefit of
returning a flag to indicate success or failure.</p>

<p>The second constructor loads the dynamic library at construction time. It is equivalent to
calling the first constructor followed by load.</p>

<p>The destructor unloads the library if it is loaded by calling the unload method, otherwise it does nothing.</p>

<p>The load method tries to load the dynamic library named by the
  string parameter. The library must be the raw name of the library
  with no prefix or extension. For example, on Unix-like operating
  systems the library "xyz" will be mapped onto the filename libxyz.so
  whereas on Windows it will be mapped onto xyz.dll. To keep this
  platform independent, the dynaloader takes only the raw name,
  i.e. "xyz".</p>

<p>If the dynamic library referred to is loaded successfully then the
method returns true. If not, the error fields are filled in and it
  returns false - see later for details of error handling.</p>

<p>The load method has an optional second argument that specifies the
directory to load the library from (e.g. "."). If present this is the
only place the loader looks. If absent, the loader uses the platform
specific path lookup to find the library.</p>

<p>On Gnu/Linux for example, the following is a typical search path:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the set of colon-separated directories in environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH</li>
  <li>the ldconfig cache</li>
  <li>/lib and /usr/lib</li>
</ul>

<p>On Windows, the following is a typical search path:</p>

<ul>
  <li>directory of the calling program</li>
  <li>system directory</li>
  <li>Windows directory</li>
  <li>current directory</li>
  <li>the set of colon-separated directories in environment variable PATH</li>
</ul>

<p>The unload method unloads the library if it is loaded, returning true if the unload succeeded. If
not, the error fields are filled in and it returns false - see later for details of error
handling.</p>

<p>The loaded method can be used as a test to see if the library is currently loaded. This is useful
if the second constructor was used to see if the load succeeded, since constructors cannot return
success flags.</p>

<h2 id="symbols">Symbol Loader Methods</h2>

<p>Functions can be loaded from the dynamic library and called. When referring to loadable
functions, the convention is to call them "symbols" and this naming convention is used in the
interface.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
namespace stlplus
{

  class dynaload
  {
  public:

    ...

    ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // symbol management

    // test whether a function is exported by the library
    bool present(const std::string&amp; name);

    // get the function as a generic pointer
    void* symbol(const std::string&amp; name);

    ...

  };

}
</pre>


<p>The present method can be used to test whether a dynamic library exprts a symbol with the given
name. If it does, then it is safe to load that symbol. If not, then trying to load the symbol will
fail. It is not necessary to use this - loading a missing symbol returns null and this can then be
tested. However, using present prevents the error fields from being filled in for when you want to
do your own error handling.</p>

<p>The symbol method loads the symbol and returns the address of the function as a C-style generic
pointer of type void*. This pointer should be cast onto a suitable function-pointer type and then
called. See the following section on <a href="#pointers">Function Pointers</a>.</p>


<h2 id="errors">Error Handling</h2>

<p>If an error occurs when loading or unloading a library or when getting a symbol, the error fields
of the dynaload class get set and can then be tested by your program. An error is in two parts: an
error code indicating which operation (load, unload, symbol) failed and a text string returned by
the operating system to explain the error further.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
namespace stlplus
{

  class dynaload
  {
  public:

    ...


    ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // error management

    // enum values to indicate type of error
    enum error_t {no_error, load_error, unload_error, symbol_error};

    // test whether there has been an error
    bool error(void) const;

    // clear an error once it has been handled (or ignored)
    void clear_error(void);

    // get the type of the error as indicated by the enum error_t
    error_t error_type(void) const;

    // get the text of the error as provided by the OS
    std::string error_text(void) const;

    ...

  };

}
</pre>

<p>The error function tests whether there has been an error - it returns true if there has, false if
not.</p>

<p>The clear_error method clears any error information dtored in the dynaload object. This is done
when an error has been handled and you want to be able to check for future errors.</p>

<p>The error_type method returns the enumeration value indicating the type of the error. This can
have one of 4 values:</p>

<ul>
<li>no_error: there hasn't been an error</li>
<li>load_error: an error occurred when trying to load the dynamic library</li>
<li>unload_error: an error occured when trying to unload the library</li>
<li>symbol_error: an error occured when trying to get a symbol from the library</li>
</ul>

<p>The error_text method returns the error message returned by the operating system to explain the
error. The messages cannot be listed here because they are operating-system dependent. However,
since it comes from the operating system, it should therefore be in the local language.</p>

<h2 id="pointers">Function-Pointers</h2>

<p>The symbol method returns a handle to a function in the dynamic library. It gives you that handle
in the form of a generic C-style pointer of type void*. So, how do you use this?</p>

<p>The key to this is to understand how function-pointers work. A function-pointer has a type which
is defined by the parameter profile of the function. For example, say you had a function with the
following parameter profile:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
int minimum(int, int);
</pre>

<p>To define a function-pointer to contain the address of this type, you start with a typedef:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
typedef int (*two_int_fn)(int, int);
</pre>

<p>Note how the function profile is changed into a function-pointer type by adding the typedef
keyword and placing (* and ) around the function name. The function name is then converted into a
typename that describes the type in a meaningful way - in this case the type is called two_int_fn
because it can be used to point to a function that takes two int arguments.</p>

<p>You can declare a variable of this function-pointer type and then assign the address of a
function to it. The address of a function is obtained from the dynaload class using the symbol
method. This returns a void* which must be type-cast onto the appropriate type. So, you end up with
code that looks like this:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
dynaload arithmetic_fns("arithmetic");

two_int_fn minimum = (two_int_fn)arithmetic_fns.symbol("minimum");
two_int_fn maximum = (two_int_fn)arithmetic_fns.symbol("maximum");

if (!arithmetic_fns.error())
{
  // use the functions
}
</pre>

<p>Now that you have the function-pointers, how do you call the functions? Well, the
function-pointer variables become function names and can simply be called with the requisite number
of parameters:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
int result = minimum(a, maximum(b, c));
</pre>
