<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>These are a set of basic rules that I developed at a previous company that I worked for to try to
minimise the incompatibilities in interfaces between different people's code by adopting a standard
set of coding rules and guidelines. They are intended to be a minimum set since I don't see the
point in dictating silly things like code layout. </p>


<h2 id="1">1. Use the STL</h2>

<p>Basic data structures should be implemented using the STL template classes
wherever they are appropriate. Most of these are container classes
implemented using templates but there are other less-used headers too. You
should not write your own list structures, sets etc.</p>

<p>String processing should use the STL string type in preference to
char*. Indeed, char* should be considered obsolete.</p>

<p>The STL provides:</p>

<table cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>string</td><td>dynamic string type</td></tr>
<tr><td>vector</td><td>dynamic array container</td></tr>
<tr><td>list</td><td>basic list container </td></tr>
<tr><td>deque</td><td>double-ended queue container</td></tr>
<tr><td>pair</td><td>A container for holding a collection of two related objects</td></tr>
<tr><td>map</td><td>associative storage container</td></tr>
<tr><td>multimap</td><td>as map container but with multiple entries per key</td></tr>
<tr><td>set</td><td>associative storage container</td></tr>
<tr><td>multiset</td><td>as set container but with multiple entries per key</td></tr>
<tr><td>algorithm</td><td>sorts, searches etc. acting on containers</td></tr>
<tr><td>functional</td><td>predicates etc. acting on containers</td></tr>
<tr><td>iostream</td><td>I/O system - but see notes below on I/O</td></tr>
</table>

<p>There are a number of books around on using the STL. However, I can't recommend one because I
haven't found a <em>good</em> one yet. A reasonably-useful online guide is to be found at 
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/">CPlusPlus.com</a>.</p>


<h2 id="2">2. Use STLplus</h2>

<p>The STLplus library has three objectives: it extends the STL by providing
extra template classes; it deals with portability issues as discussed in the
section <a href="#9">"Make your code portable"</a>; and
it provides a lot of utilities which you will find useful.</p>

<p>The STLplus provides the following continer classes:</p>

<table cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>smart_ptr</td><td>A memory managing container for holding a single object</td></tr>
<tr><td>digraph</td><td>A directed graph container</td></tr>
<tr><td>hash</td><td>A chained hash table container with similar interface to map</td></tr>
<tr><td>matrix</td><td>A 2-dimensional matrix container</td></tr>
<tr><td>ntree</td><td>A rooted tree container</td></tr>
<tr><td>triple</td><td>A container for holding a collection of three related objects</td></tr>
<tr><td>foursome</td><td>A container for holding a collection of four related objects</td></tr>
</table>


<h2 id="3">3. Use std::string</h2>

<p>If you look at old C programs that do string handling using char* (or char[]) buffers,
you will find a mess - every time. There will be constant juggling of buffers, reallocation
to avoid overflow, etc. All of this simply shows that the C-style char* is a bad choice of
data type for string handling.</p>

<p>All this hassle - and a lot of potential bugs - can be avoided by simply not using char*
at all. All string handling should be done using std::string throughout.</p>

<p>If you do need to call a C system function that has char* interfaces, then it is a good
policy to put a C++ wrapper around it that does all the conversions to/from std::string.
The wrapper function should have only std::string in the interface.</p>

<p>A corollary of this rule is that all C runtime functions using char* interfaces should be
considered obsolete and either not used - if there is a C++ equivalent - or wrapped in
such a C++ layer before use.</p>


<h2 id="4">4. Use IOStream</h2>

<p>In C++ you have a choice between three I/O systems (unistd from C, stdio
from C and iostream from C++). This can cause incompatible interfaces.
Therefore it is good practice to standardise on one.</p>

<p>This choice is simple since it is best to consider the C libraries as obsolete in general,
although they are useful in some special circumstances. Therefore, all I/O interfaces
should use IOStream since this is the only C++ I/O system.</p>

<p>There is also support in the STLplus library for a binary dump format. This has the advantage
that any data structure that is dumped can later be restored - it is a two-way mechanism, whereas
text I/O is typically human-readable but one-way. See the <a href="persistence.html">persistence</a>
functions for details.</p>


<h2 id="5">5. Modularise</h2>

<p>The recommendation is to have one subsystem declared per header. A subsystem may be a class, with
possibly sub-classes declared in the same header. Or it could be a collection of closely-related
functions. For that matter it could be one function. The header file should have the same name as
the subsystem (no naff abbreviations, you're not limited to 8 letter filenames anymore and haven't
been for decades) with the extension .hpp for C++ headers and .h for C-only headers.</p>

<p>Source code should be contained in a file with the same name as the header
but with a .cpp extension for C++ and a .c extension for C-only.</p>

<p>I recommend <strong>not</strong> putting template implementations in headers since headers also
need to be human-readable. It is amazing how many headers are not human-readable and I consider this
incompetence. However, there is a requirement that template implementations are visible to the
compiler in the same way as headers, so should not be put in .cpp files either. My solution to this
is to have a third file type with a .tpp extension which contains template implementations. This I
#include at the end of the .hpp file that declares the templates so that any code calling a template
will have access to both declaration and implementation.</p>


<h2 id="6">6. #Include Rules</h2>

<p>Include only the minimum set of headers in a header file needed to make all
the types used in the header available. Any additional headers needed in the
C++ body should be included in the body file. This minimises the number of
includes that someone including your header will inherit from you and is
considered friendly.</p>

<p>Use a sentinel within each header so that the includes in a file become
order independent. A sentinel puts a pre-processor conditional around the
whole header file which means that, no matter how many times it is included,
the contents will only be included once. At the very start of the file (I mean
lines 1 and 2), for a header called my_stuff.h, the sentinel would look like
this:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
#ifndef MY_STUFF_H
#define MY_STUFF_H
</pre>

<p>and at the
very end of the file (and I mean the very last line):</p>

<pre class="cpp">
#endif
</pre>

<p>The name of the sentinel here is created by uppercasing the filename and
changing the dot to an underscore. Some people add a double leading underscore
on the name. This is perfectly acceptable. The aim is to ensure that all
sentinel names are different. The second style is:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
#ifndef __MY_STUFF_H
#define __MY_STUFF_H
</pre>

<p>Finally, never include the &quot;using namespace std&quot; clause in a
header. All STL classes referred to in the header should have the std::
namespace prefix added - for example, string should be referred to as
std::string within headers. The reason for this rule is that it is considered
unfriendly to people who may wish to include your header in their code to dump
all of the std namespace into their code against their wishes, which is what
the using... clause does.</p>

<p>In body files, you are free to do what you like with namespaces, since
no-one includes body files. By the way, the preferred way of including a C++
system header is:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
#include &lt;string&gt;
</pre>

<p>Note the lack of an extension.</p>

<p>Also note that for C system headers, there are two forms. The normal form
still works:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
</pre>

<p>This is just as in C and makes the stdlib functions and types available.
However, you can drop the &quot;.h&quot; and add a &quot;c&quot; prefix and it
puts the header into the std:: namespace:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
</pre>

<p>If you now add the "using namespace std" then you're back to where you
started, but you could alternatively refer to the contents of stdlib with the
std:: prefix. </p>


<h2 id="7">7. Exceptions</h2>

<p>Exceptions should only be used for error conditions. They should not be part of the normal
execution path of a program. It may seem that an exception can be used to return a value of a
different type from the declared return type of a function, but this is extremely bad practice since
it obfuscates your code. It also has performance implications, because compiler writers are under
absolutely no obligation whatsoever to make exception handling fast. Indeed, there is an unwritten
rule that code optimisation should focus on speeding up the normal operation of a program, not the
erroneous operation so the implementation of exception handling is usually designed to minimise
impact on normal operation.</p>

<p>Mere user errors or input errors should be indicated by returning an appropriate value from a
function, setting a flag, dropping out of a loop or other 'normal' C++ operations. Only program
failures should be handled by exceptions.</p>


<h2 id="8">8. New/Delete versus Malloc/Free</h2>

<p>You should always <code>delete</code> an object created using <code>new</code> and always <code>free</code>
an object created using <code>malloc</code>. This is because the C++ memory manager is not guaranteed to
be compatible with the C memory manager, even though it usually is. Note there is a difference
between "guaranteed" and "usually". Just because "it works" with your compiler does not make it
correct. It will probably <strong>not</strong> work with another compiler or a later edition of your
current one.</p>

<p>Furthermore, <code>realloc</code> should only be used on memory
allocated with <code>malloc</code>, never memory created with <code>new</code>.</p>

<p>You need to keep open the possibility of adding either a cached or debugging version of the
memory manager. For example, a cached memory manager could speed up <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>
but in a way which could make them incompatible with <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>.</p>

<p>The easiest way of ensuring this rule is to only use <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> and
consider <code>malloc</code>, <code>realloc</code> and <code>free</code> to be obsolete, which of course they
are, along with most of the C runtime.</p>


<h2 id="9">9. No Static Objects</h2>

<p>You may wish to repackage some or all of your code as a shared library (DLL
in Windows-speak) so all code should really be written with this possibility
in mind. There can be problems with globals (specifically class globals which
need to be constructed) in shared libraries and these problems vary between
operating systems and compilers.</p>

<p>My preference is to try to avoid the problem by avoiding statics
altogether. This is easy when you start from scratch, but with legacy code it
is not always as simple as it sounds.</p>

<p>Fortunately, basic types such as bool, int and all pointers are not
affected by this problem. Thus, if you <em>really</em> must have a global class
object, make it a global pointer to a class object and dynamically allocate
the object on first use:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
static my_stuff* stuff = 0;

bool do_something_now(...)
{
  if (!stuff) stuff = new my_stuff(...);
  ...
}
</pre>


<h2 id="10">10. Make your code portable</h2>

<p>I believe that <em>everyone</em> is responsible for writing portable code at all times. It is <em>not</em> an SEP
(someone else's problem). You do not know what will happen to your code in the future - notice for
example how Gnu/Linux is faring now against Windows. Ten years ago Unix-type OSs were seen as
scientific-interest only - now they are mainstream. Do you want to be adaptable in the future? Then
make your code portable!</p>

<p>There are three issues relating to portability:</p>

<h3>1) Portability between compilers</h3>

<p>On Windows you might use Visual C++ or you might use Gnu gcc. On Gnu/Linux you'll be using
Gnu's gcc. On Macintosh you will possibly be using gcc again, but there are other choices.
Therefore, if there is any possibility of your code needing to be portable, all code must
compile with both compilers. In practice this is pretty easy since there are only slight
differences between them.</p>

<h3>2) Portability between Run-time Libraries</h3>

<p>You should only use standard library functions - ANSI C run-time library and the standard C++
run-time library. You should not use any non-standard system calls. Nor should you use any extensions to
the libraries, such as extra classes that a compiler vendor may have added to the STL. Nor should
you use non-standard 'features' of the standard library functions.</p>

<h3>3) Portability between Operating Systems</h3>

<p>Rule (2) goes a long way to meeting this rule, but there are some things that you have to do
which are different between Windows and Unix. The three specific areas that could affect your
development are in file-system handling, internet access and in subprocess handling. These are
solved by using the STLplus library interfaces for the <a href="file_system.html">File System</a>,
<a href="tcp_sockets.html">TCP Sockets</a> and <a href="subprocesses.html">Subprocesses</a> respectively. These
implement both a Windows and a Unix version of these subsystems accessed through a
platform-independent interface.</p>

<p>If you need to add other functionality that is platform-specific, then you should think about
providing a Unix and a Windows implementation. You should encapsulate (that means hide) it behind a
common platform-independent interface in the same way as the above STLPLus subsystems. There should
therefore be no &quot;#ifdef WIN32&quot; or other platform-specific compiler switches anywhere else
in your application code.</p>


<h2 id="11">11. Avoid the C Runtime Library</h2>

<p>The truth is that the C runtime library is obsolete. Yes, it is. Practically all of the
functionality of the C runtime is provided in a better, more effective and more robust form in the
C++ runtime library. For example, the I/O routines of stdio are superceded and vastly improved by
iostream.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there are some functions in the C runtime that are positively
<em>dangerous</em> and should never be used. They should never have been written. Their
use in a program is positive proof of an incompetent programmer. An example is the
monster called <code>sprintf</code>. Let me explain why this should never, ever, ever
<em>ever</em> be used. Ever.</p>

<p>First look at the interface:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
int sprintf(char *, const char *, ...);
</pre>

<p>The first argument is a char* buffer to print into. The function prints text into this
buffer according to the format string which is the second argument and the argument-vector
parameters represented by the elipsis (...). What's missing is a parameter that tells
sprintf how long the buffer is - so it doesn't know the buffer size and assumes that it is
infinite. So, the function has no way of knowing if an overflow happens and cannot prevent
it. If the buffer is <em>not</em> long enough, then the function quite happily runs off the end and
corrupts other data structures in memory. This kind of memory bug is extremely difficult to
diagnose and fix. A common bodge (yes, it is a bodge, not a solution) is to simply make the
buffer very large. However, that just pushes the problem further away, it doesn't fix it.
Consider the case where one of the parameters in the format string is a command-line
argument. You as a programmer have no control over the length of this argument. Therefore
you have no way of deciding how big the buffer should be. Any "guess" at the size is a
bodge.</p>

<p>This horror of a function is commonly exploited by virus writers who send very long requests to
web servers so that sprintf overflows its buffer and overwrites program code, replacing it with
virus code. If sprintf did not exist in this form, we'd probably have fewer viruses.</p>

<p>IOStream provides functions for formatting text in a string (namely, a string-stream)
that has no potential overflow problems. Therefore there is no justifiable use for
sprintf.</p>

<p>In any case, using char* for string handling is obsolete because you have to write buckets of
code to constantly check for possible buffer overflows. You should be using std::string which
dynamically allocates more memory as required, so you can get on with writing the real code.</p>

<p>Note also that rule <a href="#7">7</a> explained why malloc/free/realloc
are obsolete and potentially dangerous.</p>
